# Genesis
An attempt to make pregnancy and post-birth smoother



# Why Genesis?

According to WHO India has one of the highest MMR ( Maternal Mortality Rate).It increases by 45% to 65% as we move toward the rural areas. Due to lack of availablity of proper health care facilities in villages pregnant women either need to travel far to the cities for regular check-ups or many of them avoid it due to the inconvenience faced. However its neither good for the mother nor for the childs health. 
Every day in 2020, almost 800 women died from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth.Almost 95% of all maternal deaths occurred in low and lower middle-income countries in 2020, and most could have been prevented. Care by skilled health professionals before, during and after childbirth can save the lives of women and newborns.
